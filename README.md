# Automatic correction of spatial uneven distribution of plant and animal species
Python package for correcting spatial irregularities in plant and animal species. The function reduces the size of the data by removing rows that cause unevenness. The data is suitable for subsequent modeling (for example, in MaxEnt). The ideal data would be occurances.txt from GBIF.com
